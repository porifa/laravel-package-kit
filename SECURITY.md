## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities in porifa/laravel-package-kit, don't hesitate to report them.

1. To report a security issue, please email at <AamirSohailKmAs@gmail.com> instead of using issue tracker.

1. Describe the vulnerability, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

1. If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

1. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

1. Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

1. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
